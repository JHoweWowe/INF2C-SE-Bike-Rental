# INF2C-SE-Bike-Rental
INF2C- Software Engineering Coursework

## Description
Our team of two, Justin Howe and Rohan Nittur, were instructed to create an abstract model of a federal bike rental system in Scotland.
This coursework was divided into three parts: Requirements, Design, and Implementation. Each of those parts all represent a step in the Waterfall model in the software development cycle.

The first part required our team to write a elaborate detailed report on the bike rental system requirements.
The second part involved describing the design of our bike rental system. This also included explaining and drawing out UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams and communication diagrams.
The third and final section was implemented in code, where we were required to not only write the code but also write JUnit tests to demonstrate that our code was functioning properly and had zero logical errors.

## Notes
Please refer to the instructions folder for more details and all three of our report files are in the reports folder.
In addition, ignore unnecessary folders and files.
The main files are in the src and tests folders.

## Learning Outcomes
This is the first project where I formally implemented software engineering skills into practice.
Learning how to use Git and GitHub was certainly an essential tool in the course and this project sharpened my programming skills in Java. Communication and teamwork is another essential skill for succeeding in the project.

## Final Remarks
This was completed Year 2, Semester 1 in University of Edinburgh Bsc. Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence course.
